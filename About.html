 <h1><strong>About</strong></h1>
 <p1>Welcome to Sherlock Holmes Blogs.</p1>
 <br>
 <p1>This is my personal space on the internet—something I want to build, grow, and keep permanent. I created this site as a place to document my thoughts, my days, the things I learn, and the small stories that happen in everyday life. It’s partly a blog, partly a diary, partly a workshop where I improve my skills in web development, especially HTML, CSS, and later JavaScript.</p1>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p2>The name Sherlock Holmes Blogs comes from my admiration for detective stories and the Sherlock Holmes universe. I like the atmosphere of mystery, observation, and quiet thinking. Holmes solves problems by noticing details that others ignore—and in this blog, I want to do something similar: take simple moments from my life and look at them closely, understand them, and record them in a way that has meaning.</p2>
<br>
<br>
<p3>This website is a long-term project. I don’t want it to be something temporary or something I forget about after a week. I want to keep it going consistently—daily or weekly—so that over time, it becomes a timeline of my growth. Every post will show a piece of who I was at that time, what I was thinking, what I was working on, and what I was trying to understand.</p3>
<br>
<br>
<p4>I am also using this website to improve my technical skills. Writing HTML by hand, learning how to structure pages, experimenting with layouts, links, and styles—all of these are small steps toward becoming better at web development. I believe the best way to learn is to build something real, and this is my real project.</p4>
<br>
<br>
<p5>So if you’re here reading, thank you.
Maybe you are just passing by, or maybe you’ll stay and follow the journey.
Either way, this is where I write my story, one post at a time.</p5>
